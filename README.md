# Movie-Selector ![Film Icon](film.ico)

Couldn't decide what movie to watch, so created this little app. Randomly selects a file in the current directory and opens it up, so I don't have to make the hard decision of choosing.

key-maker.py needs to be run first in order to create Windows registry keys for applciation. Once reg keys are created, the movie selector script will appear in the right hand context menu. Enter folder with movies, right click and select Movie Selector, and one the folders will be opened randomly.
